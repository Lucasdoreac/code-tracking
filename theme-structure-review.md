# Theme Structure Review

## Fixed Issues
1. Dark mode toggle appearing in Elementor editor
   - Added check in `ludoc/inc/dark-mode.php` to prevent the toggle from showing in editor mode

## File Structure Analysis
1. Theme files are correctly placed in the `ludoc` directory following WordPress theme structure
2. Proper organization of files:
   - `inc/` directory contains theme functionality
   - `assets/` contains JS and CSS
   - `template-parts/` contains template partials
   - `page-templates/` contains custom page templates

## Recommendations
1. No incorrect file locations found - all files follow WordPress theme structure conventions
2. Theme files are properly separated from plugin functionality
3. All JavaScript and CSS assets are correctly placed in the assets directory
4. Template parts are correctly organized in template-parts directory
5. Theme functions are properly separated into individual files in the inc directory

The theme structure follows WordPress best practices and no major inconsistencies were found.
